## Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data to Understand Public Opinion on Brands ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¬

As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I had the opportunity to analyze social media data to understand the public sentiment and attitude toward specific brands. 

## Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I did:

âœ… Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the dataset, which included tweets, sentiment labels, and brand names.
Addressed missing values and ensured the data was ready for analysis.
âœ… Text Vectorization & Topic Modeling:
Applied CountVectorizer to transform tweet content into a matrix of token counts.
Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to extract insights into the common themes and topics in the tweets related to the brands.
âœ… Sentiment Visualization:
Created pie charts to visualize the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and brand popularity.
Used seaborn and matplotlib to generate bar charts that compared sentiment across different brands.
âœ… Word Cloud Visualization:
Generated WordClouds to visualize the most frequently mentioned words across all tweets, as well as separate word clouds for each brand. This helped identify trending topics and brand-related keywords.

This task allowed me to gain hands-on experience with text data analysis, sentiment detection, and topic modeling, using powerful libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and WordCloud.

Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this project and am looking forward to applying these skills in future projects!
